Linear Regression Model - Energy Production vs Electricity Demand
Project Overview
  This project demonstrates the application of a simple linear regression model to predict electricity demand based on energy production. Using historical data, the model analyzes the relationship between these two variables and provides predictions and evaluations based on the model's performance.

Objectives
  The main goal of this project is to:
  Build a linear regression model to study the correlation between energy production and electricity demand.
  Evaluate the model's performance using RÂ² (coefficient of determination).
  Visualize the real vs. predicted data points with a regression line.
Data
  The dataset used in this project contains two main features:
  energy_production: A list of energy production values (MW).
  electricity_demand: A corresponding list of electricity demand values (MW).
File Structure
  regression_model.ipynb: The main Python notebook containing all the steps of the analysis and the code used to build, train, and evaluate the regression model.
energy_demand_data.csv (optional): A CSV file with the energy production and demand data if you'd like to use external data files.
